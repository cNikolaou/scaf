description: A simple tutorial for developing and deploying a simple game on Sui
---

In the following pages you are going to learn about how to develop and deploy
your own simple game on the Sui blockchain. We are going to build on the
concepts of how Sui works and how to develop and deploy Sui smart contracts.

Each lessons will consist of Sui smart contracts and, in most cases, scripts
to interact with them.

You can find the accompanying code for the lessons in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cod-Labs/learn-sui-with-scaf)

There you will find:
- The Sui smart contract code under the `./packages/` directory, for each lesson.
- Scripts to interact with the smart contracts under the `./scripts/` directory.

The following lessons are a work in progress. Information will be added based
on feedback and requests received on the GitHub [issue tracker]().
