## What you can do with Scaf...

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Develop & Deploy" icon="document">
    Develop Sui Move smart contracts and deploy them to Sui. Scaf uses the
    `sui` CLI to build your Sui Move smart contracts, and provides
    functionality to deploy your smart contracts on the Sui blockchain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project-specific Local Sui Network" icon="laptop">
    Spin a local project-specific network from a customisable genesis state, for
    more control during the development of your smart contracts. The
    project-specific networks allows you to have multiple projects on the same
    machine, each with its own network state.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simulate & Test" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Write scripts that interractions with packages on a local nor public Sui
    network. You can imulate different interraction with your packages locally
    or on `devnet` or `testnet` before you deploy on `mainnet` and test your
    smart contracts to elimiate bugs or exploits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Educate" icon="open-book">
    You can use Scaf for educational purposes by writing multiple versions of the
    same package under the `packages/` directory, and you can have supporting
    scripts that interract with them. Each package can contain work that builds
    on concepts introduced on the previous packages and the repository can be
    shared with others.
