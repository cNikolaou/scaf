Scaf is a development environment for the Sui blockchain. With Scaf you can:
- Develop, build, and deploy [Sui Move smart contracts](https://docs.sui.io/build/move).
- Interract with Sui Move smart contracts on `mainnet`, `testnet`, `devnet`,
    and `localnet`.
- Manage a local project-specific Sui network for development, testing, and
    simulating contract interraction.

# Prerequisites

Scaf requires the `sui` CLI for building the Sui Move smart contracts and for
